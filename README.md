# Django Simple Website Build

I am following the tutorial of [Cory Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p&index=1)
on Django.  I have already started and am on video 3 of 17, it is a very long lecture video and I will try to follow all of it. 
I have been doing a series of video lectures on things that I am interested in because: 
1. I want to build a better sense of how to read and utilize more than data science libraries in python
1. I want to get proficient in reading different type of python scripts
1. I want to build cool shit!!! 

Let's get it! 

I have already created User profiles, automatically create users when someone registers to the website, and a 
bunch of other cool shit.
